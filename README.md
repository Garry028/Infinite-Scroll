# React Infinite Scroll with Vite

This is a simple React application demonstrating how to implement infinite scroll using Vite as the build tool.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd your-infinite-scroll-repo

Install the project dependencies:

Start the development server:

bash

    npm run dev

    Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Implementation Details

This project uses the react-infinite-scroll-component library to achieve infinite scrolling in a React application. The ScrollableList component fetches and displays items as you scroll down.
